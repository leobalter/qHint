#qHint - the unify of jsHint and qUnit

this is a fork from @gyoshev repo's that's integrates jsHint to qUnit.

I'd just made it running with other js libraries than jQuery.

#Integrating jsHint into qUnit

This is a demo how to integrate jsHint coding style validation into qUnit unit tests. For more information, see the blog post [Enforcing coding conventions with jsHint and qUnit](http://blog.gyoshev.net/2011/04/enforcing-coding-conventions-with-jshint-and-qunit)

    qHint(*name*, *file* [, *options*]);
